Most people are more attracted by recent works. Who cares about some 20 years old paper when you can play with Node.js?</p></blockquote><p>io.js! LOL</p><blockquote><p>a vision of objects like little virtual machines, offering specialized services. Objects were meant to be smart. Hide data, expose behavior. It&#x2019;s more than that: Alan is very explicit about the idea of methods as goals, something you want to happen, unconcerned about how it is going to happen.</p></blockquote><p><strong>expose behavior</strong></p><blockquote><p>It is unfortunate that much of what is called &#x201C;object-oriented programming&#x201D; today is simply old style programming with fancier constructs</p></blockquote><p>Is he talking about me? I am trying hard!!!</p><blockquote><p>Software development is about discovering and encoding knowledge. Now, humans have relatively few ways to encode knowledge: a fundamental strategy is to name things and concepts.</p></blockquote><p>Good wrap-up of why naming is hard.</p><blockquote><p>If you can&#x2019;t find a proper name for the class, try naming functions. Look at those functions. What is keeping them together? You can apply them to&#x2026; that&#x2019;s the class name :-)</p></blockquote><p>I have to remember that. Maybe that could be a good session for a <a href=http://jscoderetreat.com>JSCodeRetreat</a>, finding class names.</p><blockquote><p>Handler, again, is an obvious resurrection of procedural thinking. What is an handler if not a damn procedure? Why do something need to be &#x201C;handled&#x201D; in the first place? Oh, I know, you&#x2019;re thinking of events, but even in that case, EventTarget, or even plain Target, is a much better abstraction than EventHandler.</p></blockquote><p>Ouch, that hurt. I still catch me wanting to write various Handlers. I like the EventHandler example.</p><ul><li>oop</li><li>naming</li><li>class name</li><li>software design</li><li>jscr</li></ul><h2 id=-don-t-make-objects-that-end-with-er-2014-02-04-><a href=#-don-t-make-objects-that-end-with-er-2014-02-04-><span>&#xB6;</span></a> &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t make objects that end with &#x2018;er&#x2019;&#x201D; [2014-02-04]</h2><p>I was about to write a &#x201C;Handler&#x201D; class. But I remembered that the &#x201C;er&#x201D; classes are not so good. And I mean, think about it. Even if it is a <code>RequestHandler</code> it still can do lots of things and can have many reasons to change, which breaks the Single Responsibility Principle. So I searched for it and found <a href=http://objology.blogspot.de/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html>this article</a>.</p><blockquote><p>the jst of OOP is that we bind behavior to data</p></blockquote><p>noted</p><blockquote><p>in nearly every &#x201C;er&#x201D; object case, there was a better name for it. And that giving it a better name would tend to make the design more encapsulated, less spaghetti code, in short more object oriented</p></blockquote><p>now we are getting to the meat :)</p><blockquote><p>Take some sort of &#x201C;Loader&#x201D; for example. The focus here is on the unit of work it does. [&#x2026;] Now instead replace that with a LoadRecord and a LoadStream. I&#x2019;m reasonably confident you&#x2019;ll end up with something that is more akin to what the original Founding Fathers of OOP had in mind.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example: Loader =&gt; LoadRecord</p><blockquote><p>Until you apply the mindset for a while though, you&#x2019;ll never really know.</p></blockquote><p>That is so true for a lot of things, and also a good reason why I do believe that katas have a value.<br>Just <a href=http://objology.blogspot.de/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html>read the article</a>, it&#x2019;s quite short and compact but has some nice examples in it.</p><ul><li>oop</li><li>software design</li></ul><h2 id=trash-your-servers-and-burn-your-code-immutable-infrastructure-and-disposable-components><a href=#trash-your-servers-and-burn-your-code-immutable-infrastructure-and-disposable-components><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Trash Your Servers and Burn Your Code: Immutable Infrastructure and Disposable Components</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVSNsAei0VE">a talk by Chad Fowler</a></p><blockquote><p>Software gets too complex, tests slow, test coverage doesn&#x2019;t make you feel good, so you deploy less. The less often you deploy the scarrier it becomes.</p></blockquote><p>I was just about to quote him on</p><blockquote><p>comments are a code smell, there is just no way to validate them</p></blockquote><p>which I strongly agree on. And just one sentence later he says this</p><blockquote><p>Tests are also a design smell. If you find yourself more time in your tests, and I don&#x2019;t mean in the design of your system.</p></blockquote><p>which I just can&#x2019;t follow along. Because I think the test as your first user of the code is doing exactly that for you &#x201C;driving your design&#x201D;. Especially when your code is so small and modular that you think you are doing great design that&#x2019;s when a test is so easy to write and a simple way to also verify the code later (as opposed to comments) which is the value the tests add. They serve as the docs for what your tiny-modules-composition does, they allow others to go in change requirements and learn where they have to be implemented. And so on. Don&#x2019;t they? Maybe I will get to that stage of understanding it at some point.</p><p>And Chad saying</p><blockquote><p>My intention is to write code that can&#x2019;t possibly break.</p></blockquote><p>I admire him! I think I still have lot&#x2019;s to learn.</p><blockquote><p>TDD is a great way to do design, but it is not a great way to prevent bugs</p></blockquote><p>I think we agree basically :)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVSNsAei0VE">Watch his talk</a>, it is really very good and contains enough brain food!</p><ul><li>video</li><li>testing</li></ul><h2 id=beyond-solid-the-dependency-elimination-principle-2014-01-23-><a href=#beyond-solid-the-dependency-elimination-principle-2014-01-23-><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Beyond SOLID: The Dependency Elimination Principle [2014-01-23]</h2><blockquote><p>simple pointers to create a clean, intelligible codebase that won&#x2019;t use a lot of dependencies</p><ul><li>Kill Primitive Obsession</li><li>Name things as Nouns (and not using verb nouns that have an &#x2018;er&#x2019; ending)</li><li>Remove duplication</li></ul></blockquote><p>First I read his article <a href=http://qualityisspeed.blogspot.de/2014/08/why-i-dont-teach-solid.html>&#x201C;Why I Don&#x2019;t Teach SOLID&#x201D;</a> where I didn&#x2019;t get his point, but <a href=http://qualityisspeed.blogspot.de/2014/09/beyond-solid-dependency-elimination.html>the article where the quote above is from</a> does make lot&#x2019;s of sense.
