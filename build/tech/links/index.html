At the same time he explains better object-orientation and a more functional style.</p><blockquote><p>&#x201C;get&#x201D; is an imperative word, it&#x2019;s a noise word. But it&#x2019;s an imperative. If you want to start thinking about things in an non-imperative way, stop using imperative words.<br>The words influence the way you think.</p></blockquote><p>And in case you are also wondering, like me, what &#x201C;imperative&#x201D; really means, here is wikipedia&#x2019;s explaination</p><blockquote><p>imperative programming is a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state</p></blockquote><p>And as Kevlin explains some seconds later, very well: &#x201C;get&#x201D; means to change something (or move around). Either 1) move money from one account to another or 2) change or move your marital state from single to married. But getting a year from a <code>Date</code> object does not move/change anything.</p><ul><li>object-oriented</li><li>functional</li><li>get-prefix</li><li>imperative</li><li>must watch</li><li><del>watch later</del></li></ul><h2 id=decoupling-explained-from-a-different-angle><a href=#decoupling-explained-from-a-different-angle class=linkable><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Decoupling explained from a different angle</h2><p><a href=https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney>@KevlinHenney</a> is always worth watching, so there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNKXTlCOGEc">Functional Programming You Already Know</a> by him. I would like to extract this one piece where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNKXTlCOGEc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1485">he explains decoupling</a> in a, ask I think, great way. He says:</p><blockquote><p>Let me translate &#x201C;does not care&#x201D; into computer science language. &#x201C;Does not care&#x201D; means decoupling.</p></blockquote><ul><li>functional</li><li>programming</li></ul><h2 id=globally-installed-npm-packages-evil><a href=#globally-installed-npm-packages-evil class=linkable><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Globally installed npm packages = evil</h2><p>Nothing to add to <a href=https://medium.com/@brianleroux/es6-modules-amd-and-commonjs-c1acefbe6fc0>this post</a></p><blockquote><p>Many modules [&#x2026;] encourage you to globally install them.

I thought I&#x2019;d pull out how-tos from the original draft and make a new post, just focussing on how to do these common tasks with npm.</p></blockquote><p>Windows always comes in the way again, there are some good tips here how to work around it.</p><blockquote><p>1) Rather than relying on built in commands, you could simply use alternatives - for example instead of using rm, use the npm rimraf package.<br>2) Rather than trying to use syntax that is not cross compatible, stick to just the above ones. You&#x2019;d be surprised just how much you can get done with just &amp;&amp;, &gt;, |, and &lt;.</p></blockquote><p>Finally glob&#x2019;s <code>**</code> deciphered, for me :)</p><blockquote><p>such as *.js and expand the stars out as wildcards. Using two stars allows it to search recursively.</p></blockquote><p>Version bumping is baked into NPM.</p><blockquote><p>This actually comes baked into npm (it is a package manager after all). Simply run npm version patch to increment the patch number (e.g. 1.1.1 -&gt; 1.1.2), npm version minor to increment the minor version number (e.g. 1.1.1 -&gt; 1.2.0) or npm version major (e.g. 1.1.1 -&gt; 2.0.0).</p></blockquote><ul><li>npm</li><li>tool</li><li>nodejs</li></ul><h2 id=fish-shell-2014-03-20-><a href=#fish-shell-2014-03-20- class=linkable><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Fish shell [2014-03-20]</h2><p><a href="http://fishshell.com/">Another tool I have to look at!?</a> Just found via <a href="http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/">this article</a>.</p><ul><li>shell</li><li>bash</li><li>OS</li><li>tool</li></ul><h2 id=microkanrens-2014-03-20-><a href=#microkanrens-2014-03-20- class=linkable><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Microkanrens [2014-03-20]</h2><p>I first heard <a href=https://twitter.com/bodil>@bodil</a> talk at the 2014 craftconf in Budapest where I saw her presentation where she was live coding in at least 10 languages on stage.

The people yelling at you are trying desperately to pretend like it was easy so they don&#x2019;t feel like an idiot for how long it took them to figure things out. This in turn makes you feel like an idiot for taking so long to grasp the &#x201C;easy&#x201D; concept, so you happily pay it forward, and we come to one of the two great Emperor Has No Clothes moments in computing.</p></blockquote><p>And 2) towards the end of the article, make sure to read the comparison of contributing before we had git pull requests and today with github PRs. In short, it used to be 5 steps vs. 9 steps nowadays and quite a lot more knowledge we need to contribute via PRs.</p><p>Excuse me, I have to go back and install mercurial now :).</p><ul><li>dvcs</li><li>git</li><li>svn</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-be-a-great-software-developer-2014-03-20-><a href=#how-to-be-a-great-software-developer-2014-03-20- class=linkable><span>&#xB6;</span></a> How to be a great software developer [2014-03-20]</h2><p><a href=http://peternixey.com/post/83510597580/how-to-be-a-great-software-developer>How to be a great software developer</a> is a looong read, but it&#x2019;s worth reading, since it contains lots of truths.</p><p>Refactoring is by far the most underevaluated technique of working. I mostly get the impression we like to rewrite and start on the green field. But how can the (mostly hidden) value that is there in some source code survive if we throw it away? Therefore &#x2026;</p><blockquote><p>Start with something ugly but functional and then apply and reapply yourself to that ugly and misshapen solution and refactor it back into its simplest form.</p></blockquote><p>And the goal of reafactoring is to make the thing the source does simple.</p><blockquote><p>Simplicity comes far more reliably from work than from brilliance. It comes more predictably from code written, than from thought expended. It comes from effort.</p></blockquote><p>Go learn how to write better code, if you can&#x2019;t learn how to make the ugly code you wrote nicer.</p><blockquote><p>Your code has two functions: the first is its immediate job. The second is to get out of the way of everyone who comes after you and it should therefore always be optimised for readability and resilience.</p></blockquote><p>So true</p><blockquote><p>Lazily written code slows you down, increases cycle times, releases bugs and pisses everyone off.</p></blockquote><p>Just discussed the last two days what are the right tests to write, etc. and here comes the summary in short:</p><blockquote><p>There is no intuitive answer to what the right amount of testing is. Take the time to understand what really needs tests and how to write good tests.

(And store it here, to know where to look it up).</p><p>In short. If I want to get my branch <code>about</code> to be back on top of master, I have to rebase it onto master, like this:</p><pre><code>git checkout about
git rebase master
</code></pre><p>As with everything, behave when rebasing! I believe that rebase is not meant for all situations. Sometimes it is much better to have a history visible in the commit history.</p><ul><li>git</li><li>rebase</li></ul><h2 id=links-about-naming-things><a href=#links-about-naming-things class=linkable><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Links about naming things</h2><p>While reading about naming classes, etc. I came across the obligatory <a href=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DontNameClassesObjectManagerHandlerOrData>c2 wiki article</a> and many more<br><a href=http://www.carlopescio.com/2012/03/life-without-controller-case-1.html>Life without a controller, case 1</a> by [@CarloPescio]<br><a href=http://www.eptacom.net/pubblicazioni/pub_eng/ListenToYourToolsAndMaterials.pdf>Listen to your tools and materials</a> one of the many papers by [@CarloPescio]<br><a href=http://www.smalltalk.org/downloads/papers/SmalltalkHistoryHOPL.pdf>The early history of smalltalk</a><br><a href=http://steve-yegge.blogspot.de/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html>Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns</a> by Steve Yegge<br><a href=http://www.carlopescio.com/2012/12/ask-not-what-object-is-but.html>Ask not what an object is, but&#x2026;</a> by [@CarloPescio]<br><a href=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/It-Is-Possible-to-Do-OOP-in-Java>It Is Possible to Do Object-Oriented Programming in Java</a> by <a href=https://twitter.com/KevlinHenney>@KevlinHenney</a></p><ul><li>naming</li><li>links</li><li>must read</li><li>smalltalk</li><li>oop</li></ul><h2 id=just-looks-like-oop-><a href=#just-looks-like-oop- class=linkable><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Just looks like OOP &#x2026;</h2><p>Linked in the <a href=http://objology.blogspot.de/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html>comments of this</a> I found <a href=http://www.carlopescio.com/2011/04/your-coding-conventions-are-hurting-you.html>another great article</a>, which I just have to quote.</p><blockquote><p>Unlike other disciplines, software development shows little interest for classics. Most people are more attracted by recent works. Who cares about some 20 years old paper when you can play with Node.js?</p></blockquote><p>io.js! LOL</p><blockquote><p>a vision of objects like little virtual machines, offering specialized services. Objects were meant to be smart. Hide data, expose behavior. It&#x2019;s more than that: Alan is very explicit about the idea of methods as goals, something you want to happen, unconcerned about how it is going to happen.</p></blockquote><p><strong>expose behavior</strong></p><blockquote><p>It is unfortunate that much of what is called &#x201C;object-oriented programming&#x201D; today is simply old style programming with fancier constructs</p></blockquote><p>Is he talking about me? I am trying hard!!!</p><blockquote><p>Software development is about discovering and encoding knowledge. Now, humans have relatively few ways to encode knowledge: a fundamental strategy is to name things and concepts.</p></blockquote><p>Good wrap-up of why naming is hard.</p><blockquote><p>If you can&#x2019;t find a proper name for the class, try naming functions. Look at those functions. What is keeping them together? You can apply them to&#x2026; that&#x2019;s the class name :-)</p></blockquote><p>I have to remember that. Maybe that could be a good session for a <a href=http://jscoderetreat.com>JSCodeRetreat</a>, finding class names.</p><blockquote><p>Handler, again, is an obvious resurrection of procedural thinking. What is an handler if not a damn procedure? Why do something need to be &#x201C;handled&#x201D; in the first place? Oh, I know, you&#x2019;re thinking of events, but even in that case, EventTarget, or even plain Target, is a much better abstraction than EventHandler.</p></blockquote><p>Ouch, that hurt.

But I remembered that the &#x201C;er&#x201D; classes are not so good. And I mean, think about it. Even if it is a <code>RequestHandler</code> it still can do lots of things and can have many reasons to change, which breaks the Single Responsibility Principle. So I searched for it and found <a href=http://objology.blogspot.de/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html>this article</a>.</p><blockquote><p>the jst of OOP is that we bind behavior to data</p></blockquote><p>noted</p><blockquote><p>in nearly every &#x201C;er&#x201D; object case, there was a better name for it. And that giving it a better name would tend to make the design more encapsulated, less spaghetti code, in short more object oriented</p></blockquote><p>now we are getting to the meat :)</p><blockquote><p>Take some sort of &#x201C;Loader&#x201D; for example. The focus here is on the unit of work it does. [&#x2026;] Now instead replace that with a LoadRecord and a LoadStream. I&#x2019;m reasonably confident you&#x2019;ll end up with something that is more akin to what the original Founding Fathers of OOP had in mind.</p></blockquote><p>A simple example: Loader =&gt; LoadRecord</p><blockquote><p>Until you apply the mindset for a while though, you&#x2019;ll never really know.</p></blockquote><p>That is so true for a lot of things, and also a good reason why I do believe that katas have a value.<br>Just <a href=http://objology.blogspot.de/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html>read the article</a>, it&#x2019;s quite short and compact but has some nice examples in it.</p><ul><li>oop</li><li>software design</li></ul><h2 id=trash-your-servers-and-burn-your-code-immutable-infrastructure-and-disposable-components><a href=#trash-your-servers-and-burn-your-code-immutable-infrastructure-and-disposable-components class=linkable><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Trash Your Servers and Burn Your Code: Immutable Infrastructure and Disposable Components</h2><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVSNsAei0VE">a talk by Chad Fowler</a></p><blockquote><p>Software gets too complex, tests slow, test coverage doesn&#x2019;t make you feel good, so you deploy less. The less often you deploy the scarrier it becomes.</p></blockquote><p>I was just about to quote him on</p><blockquote><p>comments are a code smell, there is just no way to validate them</p></blockquote><p>which I strongly agree on. And just one sentence later he says this</p><blockquote><p>Tests are also a design smell. If you find yourself more time in your tests, and I don&#x2019;t mean in the design of your system.</p></blockquote><p>which I just can&#x2019;t follow along. Because I think the test as your first user of the code is doing exactly that for you &#x201C;driving your design&#x201D;. Especially when your code is so small and modular that you think you are doing great design that&#x2019;s when a test is so easy to write and a simple way to also verify the code later (as opposed to comments) which is the value the tests add. They serve as the docs for what your tiny-modules-composition does, they allow others to go in change requirements and learn where they have to be implemented. And so on. Don&#x2019;t they? Maybe I will get to that stage of understanding it at some point.</p><p>And Chad saying</p><blockquote><p>My intention is to write code that can&#x2019;t possibly break.</p></blockquote><p>I admire him!

Thanks to <a href=http://twitter.com/c089>@Christoph</a> for showing me the shortest test runner there is, it runs on the command line, like this:</p><pre><code>while true; do npm test; sleep 3; done;
</code></pre><p>it assumes of course, your tests can be run via <code>npm test</code>.</p><ul><li>tdd</li><li>testing</li></ul><h2 id=speed-up-mac-os-x-yosemite-2014-01-17-><a href=#speed-up-mac-os-x-yosemite-2014-01-17- class=linkable><span>&#xB6;</span></a> Speed up Mac OS X Yosemite [2014-01-17]</h2><p>I expected my new 15&#x201D; Retina MacBook Pro to just blow my mind in terms of speed.
