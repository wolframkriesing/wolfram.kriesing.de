# TODOs

- separate the development of the system and the content (at least into separate branches)
- make headlines linkable (hover and get a link that I can copy into tweets or so)
- allow tagging - tags using lists at the end of article
- show items grouped/paging kinda
- show "read later" or "watch later" lists
- allow "* later" to be ticked off
- validate the md file, e.g. requires a double-new-line before the 
  tags at the end of an article
